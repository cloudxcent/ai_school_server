# 🚀 GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. **Go to GitHub.com** and sign in to your account
2. **Click the "+" icon** in the top right corner
3. **Select "New repository"**
4. **Fill in repository details:**
   - Repository name: `ai-school-platform`
   - Description: `🎓 AI School - Kids Learning Platform with Android App and Python Flask Backend`
   - Visibility: Choose **Public** (recommended) or **Private**
   - ❌ **DO NOT** initialize with README (we already have one)
   - ❌ **DO NOT** add .gitignore (we already have one)
   - ❌ **DO NOT** add license (you can add later)

5. **Click "Create repository"**

## Step 2: Copy Repository URL

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you a page with commands. 
**Copy the HTTPS URL** which looks like:
```
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ai-school-platform.git
```

## Step 3: Run the Commands Below

Replace `YOUR_GITHUB_URL` with the actual URL you copied from GitHub.

```bash
# Add GitHub as remote origin
git remote add origin YOUR_GITHUB_URL

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```
